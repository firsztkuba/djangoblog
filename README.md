# djangoblog
My first big project in django. Backend is done with django and frontend is almost purely done with html and css. There is a little of javascript which is only responsible for smoothly gliding post from the left side of the screen while the page is being scrolled. I used Postgres for the database and deployed everything on heroku.com. I mostly used function based views, and only took advantage of build in django class based views such as ListView or DetailView. And then I inherited from them to make specific views for all the posts, creating and deleting posts etc. I also used AWS S3 buckets for storing user profile and post images. I strongly suggest you create an account and post your feelings about this blog!
